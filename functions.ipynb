        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the primary difference between a function and a method is how they are defined and called:\n",
        "A function is an independent block of code that is defined outside of a class. It can be called from anywhere by simply using its name.\n",
        "A method is a function that is defined inside a class. It is inherently tied to an object of that class and can only be called by using an instance of that class. When a method is called, it automatically receives a reference to the specific object instance (typically named self) as its first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "- Function arguments and parameters are fundamental concepts in Python that define how data is passed into a function [1]. Though often used interchangeably in casual conversation, they refer to different parts of the function definition and call process.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, functions are primary building blocks for organizing code into reusable blocks. They can be defined and called in various ways, ranging from simple functions with no arguments to more complex ones that use type hinting, default arguments, and variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "- The return statement in a Python function serves two primary purposes:\n",
        "Exiting the function: When the return statement is executed, the function immediately terminates, and program control is passed back to the point where the function was called. Any code following the return statement within the function will not be executed.\n",
        "Returning a value (or values): The return statement is used to send a result back to the caller. A function can return any Python object, including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, or even other functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "- The core difference lies in their function:\n",
        "An iterable is the source or container of data.\n",
        "An iterator is the mechanism for accessing the data one element at a time [3].\n",
        "When you use a for loop, Python automatically performs the necessary steps: it calls iter() on the iterable to get an iterator, and then repeatedly calls next() on the iterator until StopIteration is raised [5].\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "- Generators in Python are a simple and powerful way of creating iterators. They are functions that can be paused and resumed, generating a series of values over time rather than computing all values at once and returning them in a list. This approach is highly memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences [1, 2].\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "- Generators are superior to regular functions for large/infinite data because they use lazy evaluation, yielding values one by one instead of storing everything in memory, leading to huge memory savings (memory efficiency). They allow for streaming data (data pipelines) and simpler code to create iterators, making them perfect for huge datasets, infinite sequences (like Fibonacci), and resource-intensive tasks where you process items incrementally.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "- A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined without a name using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "- The map() function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a specified function to every item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and return a map object (which is an iterator) containing the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "- The map() function applies a given function to every item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a new iterable (a map object in Python 3) containing the transformed items. It's used for transformation.\n",
        "The filter() function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True. The function (often called a predicate) acts as a condition. It's used for selection.\n",
        "The reduce() function applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value."
